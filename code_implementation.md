### 1\. Unified Market Contract

This contract will combine aspects of the Market Management and Bet Placement contracts, allowing for the creation and management of both sports betting markets and prediction markets. It should support conditional tokens representing the outcomes of events or predictions.

Features:

-   Creation of markets for sports events and prediction questions.
-   Issuance of conditional tokens representing potential outcomes (win, draw, lose, or specific outcomes for prediction questions).
-   Handling both back and lay bets, as well as buy and sell orders for conditional tokens.
-   Managing market details, including event time, conditions, and outcome verification.

Conditional Tokens: Instead of using the ERC-1155 standard, designing a similar multi-token framework that allows for the creation, trading, and redemption of outcome-specific tokens within the Cosmos SDK environment. These tokens represent a claim on the outcome of an event or prediction.

### 2\. Order Matching Contract

This contract remains largely the same in principle but extends its functionality to handle the matching of buy and sell orders for conditional tokens in addition to back and lay bets.

Enhancements:

-   Match orders based on conditional token types as well as odds and order timestamps.
-   Handle the exchange of conditional tokens between users, adjusting balances based on the outcome of events or predictions.
-   Implement logic for partial and full matches, and for improved offer scenarios in limit orders.

### 3\. Settlement Contract

Adapt this contract to settle bets in the sports exchange and to resolve outcomes in the predictions market, determining the distribution of conditional tokens or payouts.

Features:

-   Record event or prediction outcomes, potentially using oracles or trusted data feeds.
-   Determine winners based on outcomes and update the status of conditional tokens accordingly.
-   Calculate payouts and redistribute conditional tokens or native tokens among participants.
-   Deduct commission from net winnings and handle the redemption of conditional tokens for their native token value.

### 4\. Token Management and Trading Contract

This new contract focuses on the lifecycle and trading of conditional tokens within the platform.

Features:

-   Facilitate the minting, buying, selling, and burning of conditional tokens.
-   Ensure that conditional tokens can be securely traded or redeemed based on the outcomes of events or predictions.
-   Manage liquidity pools for conditional tokens to facilitate trading.
-   Implement a mechanism for price discovery of conditional tokens based on market demand and supply.

## 1. Unified Market Contract

Define the storage items required for the contract:

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult, to_binary};
use cw_storage_plus::{Item, Map};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct Market {
    pub market_id: String,
    pub market_type: String,
    pub status: String,
    pub outcomes: Vec<String>,
    pub result: Option<String>,
    pub event_timestamp: u64,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct Bet {
    pub bet_id: String,
    pub market_id: String,
    pub user: Addr,
    pub bet_type: String,
    pub outcome: String,
    pub odds: f64,
    pub stake: u128,
    pub matched: bool,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

pub const MARKETS: Map<&str, Market> = Map::new("markets");
pub const BETS: Map<&str, Bet> = Map::new("bets");
```

### Execute Function

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    CreateMarket { /* Fields */ },
    PlaceBet { /* Fields */ },
    SettleMarket { /* Fields */ },
    // Additional actions
}

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::CreateMarket { /* fields */ } => try_create_market(deps, env, info, /* fields */),
        ExecuteMsg::PlaceBet { /* fields */ } => try_place_bet(deps, env, info, /* fields */),
        ExecuteMsg::SettleMarket { /* fields */ } => try_settle_market(deps, env, info, /* fields */),
        // Handle other actions
    }
}
```
### Query Function
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    GetMarket { market_id: String },
    GetUserBets { user: String },
    // Additional queries
}

pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::GetMarket { market_id } => to_binary(&query_market(deps, market_id)?),
        QueryMsg::GetUserBets { user } => to_binary(&query_user_bets(deps, user)?),
        // Handle other queries
    }
}
```


## 2. Order Matching Contract Implementation

It's designed to facilitate the matching of bets and orders.


```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult, to_binary, CosmosMsg};
use cw_storage_plus::{Map};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct Order {
    pub order_id: String,
    pub market_id: String,
    pub user: Addr,
    pub action: String, // "buy" or "sell"
    pub token_id: String,
    pub quantity: u128,
    pub price: f64,
    pub matched: bool,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

pub const ORDERS: Map<&str, Order> = Map::new("orders");
```

### Execute Function

```rust
Copy code
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    PlaceOrder { /* Fields for order placement */ },
    MatchOrders { market_id: String }, // Optionally match orders by market
    // Additional actions as needed
}

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::PlaceOrder { /* fields */ } => try_place_order(deps, env, info, /* fields */),
        ExecuteMsg::MatchOrders { market_id } => try_match_orders(deps, env, info, market_id),
        // Handle other actions
    }
}
```

### Order Placement and Matching

```rust
fn try_place_order(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    // Parameters for order
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to validate and store a new order
    // Emit an event for order placement
}

fn try_match_orders(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    market_id: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to match orders within the specified market
    // Update orders as matched and manage conditional token transfers
    // Emit events for successful matches
}
```

## 3. Settlement Contract 

Define the storage items for markets, bets, and payouts:

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult, to_binary, CosmosMsg};
use cw_storage_plus::{Map};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct Market {
    pub market_id: String,
    pub outcome: String, // Actual outcome of the market
    pub settled: bool,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct Bet {
    pub bet_id: String,
    pub market_id: String,
    pub user: Addr,
    pub stake: u128,
    pub outcome: String, // User's bet on the outcome
    pub payout: u128, // Payout amount for the bet, if any
    pub settled: bool,
}

pub const MARKETS: Map<&str, Market> = Map::new("markets");
pub const BETS: Map<&str, Bet> = Map::new("bets");
```

### Execute Function

```rust

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    SettleMarket { market_id: String, outcome: String },
    DistributePayouts { market_id: String },
    // Additional actions as needed
}

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::SettleMarket { market_id, outcome } => try_settle_market(deps, env, info, market_id, outcome),
        ExecuteMsg::DistributePayouts { market_id } => try_distribute_payouts(deps, env, info, market_id),
        // Handle other actions
    }
}
```
### Market Settlement and Payout Distribution

```rust
fn try_settle_market(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    market_id: String,
    outcome: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to mark the market as settled with the correct outcome
    // Emit an event for market settlement
}

fn try_distribute_payouts(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    market_id: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to calculate and distribute payouts to winning bets
    // Update each winning bet with the payout amount and mark as settled
    // Emit events for successful payouts
}
```

## 4. Token Management and Trading Contract 

This is the implementation of a Token Management and Trading Contract including token creation, trading, and burning.

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult, to_binary, CosmosMsg, Uint128};
use cw_storage_plus::{Map, Item};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct ConditionalToken {
    pub token_id: String,
    pub market_id: String,
    pub outcome: String,
    pub supply: Uint128,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct Trade {
    pub trade_id: String,
    pub token_id: String,
    pub seller: Addr,
    pub buyer: Option<Addr>,
    pub quantity: Uint128,
    pub price_per_token: Uint128,
    pub status: String, // "open", "closed", "cancelled"
}

pub const CONDITIONAL_TOKENS: Map<&str, ConditionalToken> = Map::new("conditional_tokens");
pub const TRADES: Map<&str, Trade> = Map::new("trades");
```

### Execute Function

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    CreateConditionalToken { market_id: String, outcome: String },
    InitiateTrade { token_id: String, quantity: Uint128, price_per_token: Uint128 },
    AcceptTrade { trade_id: String },
    CancelTrade { trade_id: String },
    BurnConditionalToken { token_id: String, quantity: Uint128 },
    // Additional actions as needed
}

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::CreateConditionalToken { market_id, outcome } => try_create_conditional_token(deps, env, info, market_id, outcome),
        ExecuteMsg::InitiateTrade { token_id, quantity, price_per_token } => try_initiate_trade(deps, env, info, token_id, quantity, price_per_token),
        ExecuteMsg::AcceptTrade { trade_id } => try_accept_trade(deps, env, info, trade_id),
        ExecuteMsg::CancelTrade { trade_id } => try_cancel_trade(deps, env, info, trade_id),
        ExecuteMsg::BurnConditionalToken { token_id, quantity } => try_burn_conditional_token(deps, env, info, token_id, quantity),
        // Handle other actions
    }
}
```
### Token Creation, Trading, and Burning
Implement functions for managing conditional tokens and their trading:

```rust
fn try_create_conditional_token(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    market_id: String,
    outcome: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to create a new conditional token
}

fn try_initiate_trade(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    token_id: String,
    quantity: Uint128,
    price_per_token: Uint128,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to initiate a new trade
}

fn try_accept_trade(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    trade_id: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic for a buyer to accept an open trade
}

fn try_cancel_trade(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    trade_id: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to cancel an existing trade
}

fn try_burn_conditional_token(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    token_id: String,
    quantity: Uint128,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Logic to burn conditional tokens
}
